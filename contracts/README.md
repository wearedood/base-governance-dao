# Base Governance DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) built on Base blockchain for community governance and decision-making.

## Overview

The Base Governance DAO is designed to facilitate transparent, decentralized governance for the Base ecosystem. It enables token holders to participate in key decisions affecting the protocol's future development and direction.

## Features

- **Decentralized Voting**: Token-based voting system for governance proposals
- **Proposal Management**: Create, discuss, and vote on governance proposals
- **Treasury Management**: Community-controlled treasury for funding initiatives
- **Transparent Operations**: All governance activities recorded on-chain
- **Multi-signature Security**: Enhanced security through multi-sig implementations

## Smart Contracts

### BaseGovernanceDAO.sol
The main governance contract that handles:
- Proposal creation and management
- Voting mechanisms
- Execution of approved proposals
- Treasury operations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Hardhat development environment
- Base testnet/mainnet access

### Installation

```bash
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Base testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base-goerli

# Deploy to Base mainnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base-mainnet
```

## Governance Process

1. **Proposal Creation**: Community members can create proposals
2. **Discussion Period**: 7-day discussion period for community feedback
3. **Voting Period**: 5-day voting period for token holders
4. **Execution**: Approved proposals are executed automatically
5. **Implementation**: Changes are implemented according to proposal specifications

## Token Economics

- **Governance Token**: BGOV
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000 BGOV
- **Voting Power**: 1 token = 1 vote
- **Minimum Proposal Threshold**: 10,000 BGOV (1%)
- **Quorum Requirement**: 100,000 BGOV (10%)

## Security

- Audited by leading security firms
- Multi-signature wallet for treasury operations
- Time-locked execution for critical changes
- Emergency pause functionality
